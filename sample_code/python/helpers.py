    Both stdout and stderr are combined for convenience. Additionally,
    some applications may not always respect these streams and may mix
    stdout with stderr. Other parameters used here were added
    specifically with the following in mind.

    `args` is required for all calls and should be a string, or a
    sequence of program arguments. If passing a single string, either
    shell must be True or else the string must simply name the program
    to be executed without specifying any arguments.

    This can be useful if you are using Python primarily for the enhanced
    control flow it offers over most system shells and still want convenient
    access to other shell features such as shell pipes, filename wild cards,
    environment variable expansion, and expansion of ~ to a userâ€™s home
    directory.
